Sending a Whatsapp Chat using Selenium and Python


Simple Firefox Browser and selenium with Python to send whatsapp text messages which can be automated as well. The only problem with this method is that we need to scan the QR once to log into the web.whatsapp.com after that we can keep sending messages. 

The other methods to send whatsapp text messages are:
Twilio API : https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/whatsapp/quickstart/python
Yowsup API : https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup

for trying this I learnt a lot from 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/whatsapp-using-python/
https://github.com/shauryauppal/PyWhatsapp/blob/master/PyWhatsapp.py

They also talk about scheduling the code so send messages at specific timings.
